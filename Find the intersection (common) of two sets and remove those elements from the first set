Given:

first_set = {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29}
second_set = {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48}

Expected Output:
Intersection is  {57, 83, 29}
First Set after removing common element  {65, 42, 78, 23}


first_set = {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29}
second_set = {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48}
print(first_set-second_set )
