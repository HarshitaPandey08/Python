Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it



def outer(a,b):
    s=inner(a,b)+5
    return s
    
def inner(a,b):
    return a+b
print(outer(5,2))
