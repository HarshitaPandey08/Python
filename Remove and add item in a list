Write a program to remove the item present at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and at the end of the list.

Given:l1=[34, 54, 67, 89, 11, 43, 94]

Expected Output:

List After removing element at index 4  [34, 54, 67, 89, 43, 94]

List after Adding element at last  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94, 11]

l1= [34, 54, 67, 89, 11, 43, 94]
l2=l1.pop(4)
print(l1)
l1.insert(2,l2)
print(l1)
l1.append(l2)
